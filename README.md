# PBL Projects – RTL | RICSV

This repository contains a collection of Project-Based Learning (PBL) activities developed as part of my course using SystemVerilog in the Vivado environment (Linux version). Each PBL addresses a specific stage in the design and verification flow of digital systems, from RTL development to physical prototyping.

## 📚 Projects List

- [PBL01 – RTL Design Using FSM](./PBL01/)
- [PBL02 – RISC-V Machine Code Implementation]()
- [PBL03 – RISC-V Processor UVM Verification]()
- [PBL04 – Design Synthesis, STA and Prototyping]()

## 💡 About

The purpose of this repository is to document and demonstrate the practical application of digital design concepts through SystemVerilog and industry-standard tools. Each project represents a step in the full development and verification flow of a RISC-V-based digital system.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Language: SystemVerilog
- Simulation: Vivado Simulator
- Design Tool: Vivado (Linux)
- Methodology: UVM (for verification)
- Architecture: RISC-V (limited ISA subset)

## 📁 Structure

Each PBL folder contains:
- `src/`: Source files (SystemVerilog)
- `tb/` : testbench for simulation (SystemVerilog)

Alongside full documentation for the entire project:
- `documentation/`: Diagrams, reports and additional documents
